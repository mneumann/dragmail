DragMail
========

The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use and easy-to-deploy ("plug and play") mail server based on:

* [DragonFlyBSD][dfly-home]
* [OpenSMTPd][opensmtpd-home]
* [Dovecot][dovecot-home]

[dfly-home]: http://www.dragonflybsd.org
[opensmtpd-home]: http://www.opensmtpd.org
[dovecot-home]: http://www.dovecot.org

Future versions will feature automatic failover and backup, either through mutual replication (HAMMER1) or
clustering ([HAMMER2][hammer2]).
